## Questions

These are some questions which you might have about Gnamma, if the answers don't make sense [open an issue](https://github.com/gnamma/protocol/issues/new) asking for some more clarification!

### What is Gnamma?

Gnamma is essentially a Virtual Reality internet. It provides a protocol for creating, sharing and consuming Virtual Reality experiences. It is inspired by the World Wide Web, but aims to improve on some of the areas which the WWW lacked. This includes properly systemising authentication and payment, as well as setting up moderation tooling which can be used at the discretion of the experience host.

### What could Gnamma be used for?

You could use Gnamma for pretty much anything. Games, informational "libraries", educational experiences, simulations.

### Can I use my `x` to experience Gnamma?

All connections to Gnamma are made through a client. If your client supports your device, then it should work. The [client being developed by the Gnamma team](https://github.com/gnamma/client) should support most OpenVR devices.
